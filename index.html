              <h3>Online Payments: It’s all about fraud prevention and user conversion</h3>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
              Many people think of online payments as just the act of sending money
              from a consumer’s bank account to a business’ bank account - but it’s
              actually not that straightforward.
            </p>
            <p>
              In reality, online transactions are quite complicated, and that’s
              what makes them so fascinating.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this article I’ll be digging into exactly what makes them such an
              interesting topic, as well as briefly touching on their history, and
              what I believe are the two most important problems we face with
              online payments today.
            </p>
            <p>Let’s begin.</p>
            <p>
              Imagine you own a business that specialises in selling birthday cards.
              You want to expand your target market and so you decide to start selling your cards online.
              In order to sell cards online, you need to be able to accept online payments.
              It all sounds quite straightforward.
            </p>

            <p>
              Your first question needs to be - who do I want to sell my cards to?
              Well, everyone - right?<br>
              Okay, so what payment method does ‘everyone’ use? Ah - well there’s
              Mastercard, Visa, Amex… then there’s credit and debit, and some
              consumers like to pay with cash, too… and don’t forget about Klarna,
              PayPal, iDEAL… What about mobile, like ApplePay?
            </p>

            <p>
              So you’ve drawn up a list of every single payment method available
              to mankind.<br>
              What do you do next? Each of these payment methods come with their
              own API - does this mean you need a team of developers working with
              every single API to integrate all these different payment methods on
              your website?
            </p>

            <p>
              What about security? Are you going to be responsible for your
              customer’s credit card information being processed, and stored, on
              your website?
            </p>

            <p>
              Do your customers want to pay now or later? What about finance
              options? What about subscriptions?
            </p>

            <p>
              Have you thought about localisation? If our customer is from Germany,
              then the default payment methods offered to them should be popular
              in Germany.
            </p>

            <p>Pause. That’s a lot of questions, and we’ve only just begun.</p>

            <p>
              Fortunately, the internet, and payments processing, has evolved
              enough to have solutions for these problems.<br>
              Your job is to sell birthday cards - not handle payments processing
              - so let’s use a payments API to do that for us. There’s many different
              options for this - such as Stripe, Adyen, etc - your main concerns
              for this are most likely going to be what payment methods they offer,
              and the amount they charge per transaction.
            </p>

            <p>
              Stripe is a big contender in this market, so we’ll use them as an
              example here.<br>

              Stripe offer most payment methods, depending on what region
              (US, EU, etc) you’re in, including: debit cards, credit cards,
              iDEAL, Klarna, SEPA Direct Debit, WeChat Pay, Google Pay, Apple Pay,
              AliPay… the list goes on.
            </p>

            <p>
              So that’s the payment methods dealt with. What else do they
              handle?<br>
              Well, there’s risk assessment, fraud, disputes, refunds,
              subscriptions…
            </p>

            <p>
              And we haven’t even touched on security or authentication - such
              as the new requirement driven by Europe for Strong Customer
              Authentication and 3D Secure 2… But that’s an article for another
              day.
            </p>

            <p>
              So there’s a lot to consider in the world of online payments,
              and it’s constantly changing - but was it always this complicated?
              <br>Let’s take a quick look at the history of online payments.
            </p>

            <p><b>Internet Banking Services</b></p>

            <p>
              In the 1990s, Stanford Federal Credit Union becomes the first
              institution to offer online banking for its customers, but
              unfortunately this payment system required specialised knowledge
              of data transfer protocol, and wasn’t exactly user-friendly.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Nationwide Building Society also began offering internet
              banking services in 1997.
            </p>

            <p><b>E-money and Tokens</b></p>

            <p>
              Then micropayment services came along, but their focus was on
              digital alternatives to cash, such as tokens and e-money.
            </p>

            <p><b>Money Transfer Services</b></p>

            <p>
              By the end of the 1990s, PayPal had finally emerged in 1999 as
              an online money transfer service, and became popular with eBay
              customers. So popular, in fact, that eBay actually acquired PayPal
              in 2002. Paying with PayPal was easy and customers trusted it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Digital payments quickly grew and by 2007 PayPal had 35 million
              customers and an EU banking license.
            </p>

            <p><b>Fraud Prevention</b></p>

            <p>
              As early as 1999, online payment fraud was prevalent.<br>
              A security protocol for payment authentication called 3DS1 was
              released in an attempt to tackle this, by requiring the customer
              to enter in a password whenever a transaction was deemed risky by
              the card issuer. This led to a drop in customer conversion as the
              password was difficult to remember and the UI was sometimes
              confusing to the user.
            </p>

            <p>
              The specification for 3DS2 was then published in 2016, and was
              designed to increase customer conversion by implementing
              ‘frictionless transactions’, and removing a lot of the pain points
              of 3DS1.
            </p>

            <p><b>Contactless Payments</b></p>

            <p>In 2007, the first contactless payment takes place, allowing
              customers to ‘swipe’ a card quickly and easily.
            </p>

            <p>By 2018, two-thirds of UK adults use contactless payments.</p>

            <p><b>Mobile Wallets</b></p>

            <p>
              Apple launched Apple Pay in 2014, allowing people to have virtual
              wallets on mobile devices, using fingerprints as payment
              authentication. Amazon and Google also offer similar wallet
              functionality.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2018, around 16% of the adult population in the UK had
              registered for mobile payments, with around 79% of these users
              recording at least one payment.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <p>
              There’s a recurring theme here: online payments relies on a
              juggling act between the ease of payment for the customer
              (which affects customer conversion) - and the prevention of fraud.
            </p>

            <p><i>It isn’t just about the processing of money.</i></p>

            <p>
              I’m going to end the article here. Consider it a very brief
              summary of all the different problems involved in online payments.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you want to learn more, I’ll be posting about a variety of
              online payment related articles in the future, where we’ll discuss
              how you can increase conversion in online payments; what 3DS2
              actually is and whether you need it, and how providers like Stripe
              tackle payment fraud.
